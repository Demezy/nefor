# mag (plugin)

Hosts the MAG runtime: compiles `.mag` programs (via `crates/nefor-mag`) into
immutable versioned inline envelopes and runs them as constellations of
lightweight in-memory actors, folding graph modifications over an initially
empty graph. The lead
writes tiny MAG programs ad-hoc during sessions; this plugin turns them into
running workflows.

## Tool projection

Agent `tools` lists are requested capability profiles, not schema registries.
MAG snapshots the configured tool gate's owner-qualified `tool.register`
advertisement and attaches the matching descriptors to each provider request.
Providers consume that request-local snapshot, while the original names remain
the immutable allowlist enforced when a model invokes a tool. Names absent from
the runtime advertisement are omitted from the model surface instead of
failing the delegated run.

Direct providers attach `model` and `duration_ms` to terminal observations and
to usage observations when token usage exists. MAG projects those fields
unchanged, so the chat surface can render per-turn model, elapsed time, and
throughput without knowing which provider produced the response.

## Kernel

The plugin ships its own kernel Lua tree at `lua/mag-kernel/` (entry
`lua/mag-kernel/init.lua`: actor fold, factories, routing, run contexts,
observer stream). The embedded VM loads it at startup — configs no longer
carry a kernel copy. Resolution order, highest precedence first:

1. `--kernel <path>` (or `-k`) — explicit override for dev experiments and the
   plugin's integration tests.
2. `<lua-root>/../plugins/mag/lua/mag-kernel/init.lua` — the default. The
   composition threads `--lua-root` (`NEFOR_ROOT/lua`); its parent is
   `NEFOR_ROOT`, which carries the whole `plugins/` tree in every install mode
   (dev checkout, `NEFOR_LOCAL_DIR` override, or the pm sparse-clone whose cone
   includes `plugins`). No packaging step copies the kernel — it rides the same
   tree the shared Lua libs do.
3. `NEFOR_DEV_DIR/plugins/mag/lua/mag-kernel/init.lua` — in-checkout dev
   fallback when no `--lua-root` is passed.

## Explicit project builds

`mag.load` remains the cold, manifest-free compile request. `mag.build` is an
additive opt-in request; neither request starts actors. Both reply with
`mag.loaded` or `mag.error`, correlated by `in_reply_to` to the request `id`.

```json
{
  "kind": "mag.build",
  "id": "compile-1",
  "project_root": "/installed/config",
  "entry": "agentic-loop/lead-turn.mag",
  "module_roots": ["/installed/runtime/mag/lib", "mag/lib"],
  "cache_dir": "/writable/data/mag/cache",
  "no_cache": false
}
```

Project and cache roots must be explicit absolute paths. Entry must be nonempty
and relative, without `..` components. Extra module roots are optional ordered
nonempty paths; relative roots are anchored to the project. Shared compiler
preparation reads exactly `project_root/mag.toml` and constructs roots in order:
project, manifest roots, request roots (duplicates retained). Missing or invalid
manifests fail normally. No parent discovery or source staging occurs.

`mag.loaded` retains its normal `artifact`, `hash`, `factories`, and
`factory_contracts` fields. Build replies additionally contain:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "status": "hit",
    "lookup_duration_ns": 123,
    "publication_duration_ns": 0
  }
}
```

Status is `hit`, `miss`, `bypass`, or `unavailable`. `no_cache` defaults false;
true bypasses both lookup and publication. Unavailable identity disables caching;
failed storage lookup/publication instead reports `miss` and preserves successful
cold compilation. Diagnostics are outside the artifact and never affect its hash.
Errors retain the existing error reply shape, without build diagnostics.

Every build fetches fresh factory contracts. Their object keys are sorted at the
Lua-to-JSON boundary because Lua table iteration order is process-local; contract
array ordering and all values remain intact. The cache identity includes this
complete host input, original project root, relative entry, effective ordered
roots, manifest version, compiler options, and bytes of the running **mag-plugin**
executable. Live execution model snapshots are not compile inputs. Cache placement
is not identity; storage can persist independently of read-only installed source.

Hits decode the exact successful compiler bytes with a depth-safe JSON Value
parser and then use the same envelope, hash, kernel, and provider-schema preflight
as cold loads and misses. A compiler success can be cached even when Nefor rejects
its envelope. A hit is never proof of current kernel acceptance. Corrupt records
fall back to compilation. No execution state, model snapshot, source environment,
or failure is retained in this cache. Execute/apply and retained artifact lifetime
remain unchanged; deleting cache/source after loading does not dispose an artifact.
